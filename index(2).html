    <h1>Happy Birthday, My Love 💖</h1>

    <div class="love-letter">
        <p>To My Khushi 🩷 My Sweetheart 🧁 My Jaan 💋 My Bayko 💍 My Baby 🧸 My Honey 🍯 My Queen 👑 My Girl 🌸 My Favorite Person 💌 …And the only girl I’d fight the whole universe for—especially that third person who tried to test our bond 😏</p>

        <p>LOL—jokes on them, because you're already booked, blessed, obsessed & madly in love with your Hubby 😎💘</p>

        <p>You walked into my life like a dream… and every day feels like a fairytale with you, baby. 🧚🏼‍♀️💫</p>

        <p>🎂 Happy Birthday, My Love! 🎉💖</p>

        <p>Your soul feels like home to mine—every time I hear your voice or feel your presence, it’s like my heart whispers, “Finally, peace.” 🫶🏼</p>

        <p>You don’t just make me happy, baby—you make my soul smile… like it’s wearing a hoodie of your warmth and sipping chai of your love ☕💕</p>

        <p>That one day—<strong>28th May 2025</strong>—from 11:15 AM to 5:56 PM? My heart still replays it like a perfect little movie. 🎬🍿</p>

        <p>Mall mein ghummna, movie dekhna, teri haasi, tera haath pakadna—it felt like our own romantic Bollywood day out. Even the popcorn tasted better with you. 🍿💕</p>

        <p>And the way you looked at me during the movie... haayee, meri toh duniya hi ruk gayi 🥹❤️</p>

        <p>Your nakhre, your pout, your “hmm” in that fake-anger voice — 🥲✨ aww overload every time. Even when you act mad, I just want to wrap you up like a burrito in my arms forever 🫶🏼🌯</p>

        <p>We've had our cute misunderstandings too 😅—like that 5-minute “breakup” drama and you saying “You don’t love me like before!” 😭💀</p>

        <p>But baby... even when you said “Fine, don’t talk to me” (and messaged me 2 mins later “btw what did you eat?” 😂) — I never stopped loving you. Not for a second 💘</p>

        <p>When that one third person tried entering our story — we stood tall like King & Queen and said: “Not today, Satan.” 😌💅🏼</p>

        <p>Even Google doesn’t have answers to how much I love you, jaan. 💗</p>

        <p>If loving you was homework, I’d be the first bencher, baby. 😘📚</p>

        <p>Khushi, you turn ordinary days into fairytales, silence into melody, and simple moments into magic ✨💘</p>

        <p>Let’s keep dancing in malls, fighting over chocolates, and loving each other like it’s always our first day together 💏💞</p>

        <p>Forever yours, Your Loyal Bae 💘 (Hubby, Baby, Personal Fanboy, and the Official Crown-Holder of the Queen of My Heart 👑)</p>

        <p>P.S. Manifesting many more 28th May-type days with you — just you, me, love, drama & your nakhre. 🌸</p>

        <p>You’re not just my Khushi—you’re the reason behind it. ❤️</p>
